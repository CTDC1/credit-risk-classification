##Credit Risk Classification

In this repository, we have a project that trains a model based on loan risk. We are evaluating how accurate it is for identifying the creditworthiness of borrowers.  


The repo contains a CSV file called lending_data.csv, which is historical data from a peer-to-peer lending services company. 

In the file called credit-risk classification, we create two logistic regression models to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers.
